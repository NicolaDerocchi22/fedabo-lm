When conducting a *materiality* assessment on environmental subtopics, the undertaking shall assess the materiality of water and marine resources in its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain, and may consider the four phases below, also known as the LEAP approach:\n\t- (a) Phase 1: locate where in its own operations and along the *value chain* the interface with nature takes place;\n\t- (b) Phase 2: evaluate the *dependencies* and *impacts*;\n\t- (c) Phase 3: assess the material *risks* and *opportunities*; and\n\t- (d) Phase 4: prepare and report the results of the materiality assessment.\n- AR 2. The *materiality* assessment for ESRS E3 corresponds to the first three phases of this LEAP approach, the fourth phase addresses the outcome of the process.\n- AR 3. The processes to assess the *materiality* of *impacts, risks* and *opportunities* shall consider the provisions in ESRS 2 IRO-1 *Description of the processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities*, and IRO-2 *Disclosure Requirements in ESRS covered by the undertaking's sustainability statement*.\n- AR 4. The sub-topics related to water and marine resources covered by the *materiality* assessment include:\n\t- (a) water, which encompasses the consumption of *surface water*, *groundwater*, as well as withdrawals and *discharges* of water; and\n- (b) *marine resources*, which encompasses the extraction and use of such resources and associated economic activities.\n- AR 5. In phase 1, to locate where there are areas at water risk, and areas where there is an interface with *marine resources* that could lead to material impacts and *dependencies* in its own operations and along its upstream and downstream value chain, the undertaking may consider:\n\t- (a) the locations of direct assets and operations and related upstream and downstream activities across the *value chain*;\n\t- (b) the *sites* located in *areas at water risk*, including areas of high-water stress; and\n\t- (c) the sectors or business units that are interfacing with water or marine resources in these priority locations.\n- AR 6. The undertaking shall consider river basins as the relevant level for assessment of locations and combine that approach with an operational risk assessment of its facilities and the facilities of *suppliers* with material impacts and risks.\n- AR 7. The undertaking shall consider the criteria for defining the status of water bodies according to the relevant Annexes of Directive 2000/60/EC (Water Framework Directive) as well as the guidance documents provided for implementation of the Water Framework Directive. The list of guidance documents can be accessed under the European Commission's Environment home page.\n- AR 8. In phase 2, to evaluate its impacts and *dependencies* for each priority location identified under AR 5, the undertaking may:\n\t- (a) identify business processes and activities that lead to impacts anddependencies on environmental assets and *ecosystem services*;\n\t- (b) identify water and *marine resources*-related impacts and dependencies across the undertaking's value chain; and\n\t- (c) assess the severity and likelihood of the positive and negative impacts onwater and marine resources.\n- AR 9. For the identification of water and *marine resources*-related *dependencies*, the undertaking may rely on international classifications such as the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES).\n- AR 10. When identifying its *marine resources*-related *dependencies*, the undertaking shall consider if it depends upon key marine resources-related commodities, including but not limited to gravels and seafood products.\n- AR 11. *Marine resources* are defined according to their use by human societies and must be considered in relation to the pressure they are subject to. Some of the pressure indicators are presented in other ESRS, namely microplastics and *emissions* to water in ESRS E2 and plastic *waste* in ESRS E5.\n- AR 12. Examples of *marine resources dependencies* which may be considered by the undertaking are:\n\t- (a) dependencies on commercially exploited fish and shellfish in its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain; and\n\t- (b) fishing activity that involves mobile bottom trawling, which can also have negative impacts on the seabed.\n- AR 13. In Phase 3, to assess its material *risks* and *opportunities* based on the results of Phases 1 and 2, the undertaking may :\n\t- (a) identify *transition risks* and *opportunities* in its own operations and its *value chain*  by the categories of:\n\t\t- i. *policy* and legal: e.g., introduction of regulation or policy (e.g., changes such as increased water protection, increased quality of water regulations, regulation of flows of water supply), ineffective governance of water bodies or *marine*\n*resources*, in particular across boundaries (e.g., transboundary governance and cooperation) resulting in water or oceans *degradation*, exposure to sanctions and litigation (e.g., non-respect of permits or allocations; negligence towards or killing of threatened marine species), enhanced reporting obligations on marine ecosystems and related services;\n- ii. technology: e.g., substitution of products or services by products or services with a lower impacton water and marine resources, transition to more efficient and cleaner technologies (i.e., with lower impacts on oceans and water), new monitoring technologies (e.g., satellite), water purification, flood protection;\n- iii. market: e.g., shifting supply, demand and financing, volatility or increased costs of water or marine resources;\n- iv. reputation: e.g., changing societal, customer or community perceptions as a result of an organisation's impact on water and marine resources; and\n- v. contribution to *systemic risks* via its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain, including the risks that a marineecosystem collapses or the risks that a critical natural system no longerfunctions (e.g., tipping points are reached, summing physical risks);\n- (b) identify physical risk including water quantity (*water scarcity*, water stress), water quality, infrastructure decay or unavailability of some marine resources-related commodities (e.g. the rarefaction of some species of fish or other underwater marine living organisms sold as products by the undertaking) leading for instance to the impossibility of running operations in certain geographical areas;\n- (c) identify opportunities categorised by:\n\t- i. resource efficiency: e.g., transition to more efficient services and processes requiring less water and marine resources;\n\t- ii. markets: e.g., development of less resource-intense products and services, diversification of business activities;\n\t- iii. financing: e.g., access to green funds, bonds or loans;\n\t- iv. resilience: e.g., diversification of marine or water resources and business activities (e.g., starting a new business unit on *ecosystem restoration*), investing in green infrastructures, *nature-based solutions*, adopting *recycling* and circularity mechanisms that reduce the *dependencies* on water or marine resources; and\n\t- v. reputation: positive *stakeholder engagement* as a result of a proactive stance on managing nature-related risks (e.g., leading to preferredpartner status).\n- AR 14. The undertaking may rely on primary, secondary or modelled data collection or other relevant approaches to assess material impacts, *dependencies*, risks and opportunities, including Commission Recommendation 2021/2279 on the use of the Environmental Footprint methods to measure and communicate the life cycle environmental performance of products and organisations (Annex I – Product Environmental Footprint; Annex III – Organisation Environmental Footprint).\n- AR 15. When providing information on the outcome of the *materiality* assessment, the undertaking shall consider:\n\t- (a) a list of geographical areas where water is a material issue for the undertaking'sown operations and its upstream and downstream value chain;\n\t- (b) a list of *marine resources*-related commodities used by the undertaking which are material to the good environmental status of marine waters as well as for the protection of marine resources; and\n\t- (c) a list of sectors or segments associated with water and marine resources material impacts, risks and opportunities.",

For example, impacts may relate to the undertaking's value proposition (such as providing lowest cost products or services, or high-speed delivery, in ways that put pressure on labour rights in its own operations), or its cost structure and the revenue model (such as shifting inventory risk to *suppliers*, with knock-on effects on the labour rights of people who work for them).\n- AR 7. Impacts on the undertaking's *own workforce* that originate in the strategy or *business model* can also bring material *risks* to the undertaking. For example, risks arise if some people in the workforce are at risk of *forced labour*, and the undertaking is importing products into countries where the law allows for the confiscation of imported goods that are suspected of being made with forced labour. An example of *opportunities* for the undertaking may result from providing opportunities for the workforce such as job creation and upskilling in the context of a \"just transition\". Another example, in the context of a pandemic or other severe health crisis, relates to the undertaking potentially relying on contingent labour with little to no access to sick care and health benefitsthat may face severe operational and business continuity risks as workers have no choice but to keep working while sick, further exacerbating the spread of the disease and causing major *supply chain* breakdowns. Reputational and business opportunity risks linked to the exploitation of lowskilled, low-paid workers in sourcing geographies with minimal protectionsfor them are also increasing with media backlash and *consumer* preferences moving to more ethically sourced or sustainable goods.\n- AR 8. Examples of particular characteristics of people in the undertaking's *own workforce* that may be considered by the undertaking when responding to paragraph 15 relate to young people that may be more susceptible to *impacts* on their physical and mental development,\nor women in a context where women are routinely discriminated against in the terms and conditions of work, or migrants in a context where the market for the supply of labour is poorly regulated and workers are routinely charged recruitment fees. For some people in the workforce, the inherent nature of the activity that they are required to undertake may put them at risk (for example, people required to handle chemicals or operate certain equipment or low paid employees who are on \"zero hours\" contracts).\nAR 9. With regard to paragraph 16, material *risks* could also arise because of the undertaking's *dependency* on its *own workforce* where low-likelihood but high-impact events may trigger *financial effects;* for example, where a global pandemic leads to severe health impacts on the undertaking's workforce resulting in major disruptions to production and distribution. Other examples of risk related to the undertaking's dependency on its workforce include a shortage in skilled workers or political decisions or legislation affecting its own operations and *own workforce*.",

The cross-cutting standards ESRS 1 *General requirements* and ESRS 2 *General disclosures*  apply to the *sustainability matters* covered by topical standards and sector-specific standards.\n- 6. This standard (ESRS 1) describes the architecture of ESRS standards, explains drafting conventions and fundamental concepts, and sets out general requirements for preparing and presenting sustainability-related information.\n- 7. ESRS 2 establishes Disclosure Requirements on the information that the undertaking shall provide at a general level across all material *sustainability matters* on the reporting areas governance*,* strategy*, impact, risk* and *opportunity* management, and *metrics* and *targets*.\n- 8. Topical ESRS cover a sustainability topic and are structured into topics and sub-topics, and where necessary sub-sub-topics.

Sector-specific standards are applicable to all undertakings within a sector. They address *impacts, risks* and *opportunities* that are likely to be material for all undertakings in a specific sector and that are not covered, or not sufficiently covered, by topical standards. Sector-specific standards are multi-topical and cover the topics that are most relevant to the sector in question. Sector-specific standards achieve a high degree of comparability.\n- 11.

It may take time to understand negative impacts and how the undertaking may be involved with themthrough its value chain, as well as to identify appropriate responses and put them into practice. Therefore, the undertaking shall consider:\n\t- (a) its general and specific approaches to addressing material negative impacts;\n\t- (b) its social investment or other *development* programmes aimed at contributing to additional material positive impacts;\n\t- (c) how far it has progressed in its efforts during the reporting period; and\n\t- (d) its aims for continued improvement.\n- AR 26. Appropriate action can vary according to whether the undertaking causes or contributes to a material impact, or whether the material impact is directly linked to its own operations, products or services through a business relationship.\n- AR 27. Given that material negative impacts affecting communities that have occurred during the reporting period may also be linked to entities or operations outside its direct control, the undertaking may disclose whether and how it seeks to use its leverage in its business *relationships* to manage those impacts. This may include using commercial *leverage* (for example, enforcing contractual requirements with business relationships or implementing incentives), other forms of leverage within the relationship (such as providing *training* or capacity-building on the rights of indigenous peoples to entities with which the undertaking has a business relationships) or collaborative leverage with peers or other actors (such as initiatives aimed at minimising security-related impacts on communities or participating in company-community partnerships).\n- AR 28. Impacts on communities may stem from environmental matters which are disclosed by the undertaking under the ESRS E1 to E5. Examples include:\n\t- (a) ESRS E1 *Climate Change*: The implementation of *climate change mitigation* plans may require the undertaking to invest in *renewable energy* projects that may affect the lands, territories and *natural resources* of *indigenous peoples*. If the undertaking does not consult with the affected indigenous peoples , it could negatively impact the affected communities' right to *free, prior and informed consent*;\n\t- (b) ESRS E2 *Pollution*: The undertaking may negatively impact *affected communities* by failing to protect them from *pollution* from a particular production facility that causes them health-related issues;\n\t- (c) ESRS E3 *Water and marine sources*: The undertaking may negatively impact the access to clean drinking water of communities when withdrawing water in water stressed areas;\n\t- (d) ESRS E4 *Biodiversity and ecosystems*: The undertaking may negatively affect the livelihood of local farmers through operations that contaminate *soil*. Additional examples include the sealing of land through building new infrastructure, which can eradicate plant species that are critical for, for example, local *biodiversity* or to filter water for communities; or the introduction of *invasive species* (whether plants or animals)that can impact *ecosystems* and cause subsequent harm;\n\t- (e) ESRS E5 *Resource use and circular economy*: The undertaking may negatively impact the lives of communities by affecting their health through the mismanagement of *hazardous waste.*\nWhere the connection between environmental impacts and local communities is addressed in the disclosures within the Disclosure Requirements ESRS E1-E5, the undertaking may cross-referenceto those and clearly identify such disclosures.\n- AR 29. When the undertaking discloses its participation in an industry or multi-stakeholder initiative as part of its *actions* to address material negative impacts, the undertaking may disclose how the initiative, and its own involvement, is aiming to address the material impact concerned. It may disclose under ESRS S3-5 the relevant *targets* set by the initiative and progress towards them.\n- AR 30. When disclosing whether and how the undertaking considers actual and potential impacts on *affected communities* in decisions to terminate *business relationships* and whether and how it seeks to address any negative impacts that may result from termination, the undertaking may include examples.\n- AR 31. In disclosing how it tracks the effectiveness of *actions* to manage material impacts during the reporting period, the undertaking may disclose any lessons learned from the previous and current reporting periods.\n- AR 32. Processes used to track the effectiveness of *actions* can include internal or external auditing or verification, court proceedings and/or related court decisions, impact assessments, measurement systems, stakeholder feedback, *grievance mechanisms,* external performance ratings, and benchmarking.\n- AR 33. Reporting on effectiveness is aimed at enabling the understanding of the links between *actions* takenby an undertaking and the effective management of impacts.\n- AR 34. With regard to initiatives or processes whose primary aim is to deliver positive impacts for affected communities that are based on affected communities' needs, and with regard to progress in the implementation of such initiatives or processes, the undertaking may disclose:\n\t- (a) information about whether and how *affected communities* and *legitimate representatives* or their *credible proxies* play a role in decisions regarding the design and implementation of these investments or programmes; and\n\t- (b) information about the intended or achieved positive outcomes for *affected communities* ofthese investments or programmes.\n\t- (c) an explanation of the approximate scope of *affected communities* covered by the described social investment or *development* programmes, and, where applicable, the rationale for why selected communities were chosen for a given social investment or development programme's implementation.\n- AR 35. The undertaking may disclose whether any initiatives or processes whose primary aim is to deliver positive impacts for *affected communities* are designed also to support the achievement of one or more of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For example, through a commitment to advance UN SDG 5 to \"achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\" the undertakingmay be taking thoughtful measures to include women in the consultation process with an affected community to meet standards of effective *stakeholder engagement*, which can help empower the women in the process itself, but potentially also in their daily lives.\n- AR 36. When disclosing the intended or achieved positive outcomes of its *actions* for *affected communities* a distinction is to be made between evidence of certain activities having occurred (for example, that x number of women community members have been provided with *training* on how to become local*suppliers* to the undertaking) from evidence of actual outcomes for affected communities (for example, that x women community members have set up small businesses and have had their contracts with the undertaking renewed year-onyear).\n- AR 37. When disclosing whether initiatives or processes also play a role in mitigating material negative impacts, the undertaking may for example consider programmes that aim to improve local infrastructure surrounding an undertaking's operations, such as improvements in roads leading to a reduction in the number of severe traffic accidents involving community\nmembers.\n- AR 38. When disclosing the material risks and opportunities related to the undertaking's impacts or *dependencies* on affected communities, the undertaking may consider the following:\n\t- (a) risks related to the undertaking's impacts on *affected communities* may include the reputational or legal exposure, as well as operational risks, where affected communities protest against resettlements or the loss of access to lands, leading to costly delays, boycotts, or lawsuits;\n\t- (b) risks related to the undertaking's dependencies on *affected communities* may include disruption of business operations where *indigenous peoples* decide to withdraw their consent to a project on their lands, forcing the undertaking to significantly modify or abandon the project;\n\t- (c) business opportunities related to the undertaking's impacts on *affected communities*  may include more easily financing projects and being a partner of choice for communities, governments and other businesses; and\n\t- (d) opportunities related to the undertaking's dependencies on *affected communities*  may include the development of positive relationships between the undertaking and indigenous peoples that enable existing projects to expand with strong support.\n- AR 39. In disclosing the information in AR 41, the undertaking may consider explanations of risks and opportunities stemming from environmental impacts or *dependencies* (please refer to AR 31 for further details), including related human rights (or social) impacts. Examples include reputational risks stemming from the impact on the health of communities of unmanaged polluting *discharges*; or the *financial effects* of protests that may disrupt or interrupt an undertaking's activities, for example,in response to operations in water stressed areas that may impact the lives of affected communities.\n- AR 40. When disclosing whether *dependencies* turn into risks, the undertaking shall consider external developments.\n- AR 41. When disclosing policies, action and resources and *targets* related to the management of material risks and opportunities, in cases where risks and opportunities arise from a material impact, the undertaking may cross-reference its disclosures on policies, actions and resources and targets in relation to that impact.\n- AR 42. The undertaking shall consider whether and how its processes to manage material risks related to *affected communities* are integrated into its existing risk management processes.\n- AR 43. When disclosing the resources allocated to the management of material impacts, the undertaking may disclose which internal functions are involved in managing the impacts and what types of action they take to address negative and advance positive impacts.",

When developing its entity-specific disclosures, the undertaking shall carefully consider:\n\t- (a) comparability between undertakings, while still ensuring relevance of the information provided, recognising that comparability may be limited for entity- specific disclosures. The undertaking shall consider whether the available and relevant frameworks, initiatives, reporting standards and benchmarks (such as technical material issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board or the Global Reporting Initiative) provide elements that can support comparability to the maximum extent possible; and\n\t- (b) comparability over time: consistency of methodologies and disclosures is a key factor for achieving comparability over time.\nAR 5.

For example, impacts may relate to the undertaking's value proposition (such as providing lowest cost products or services, or high-speed delivery, in ways that put pressure on labour rights in its own operations), or its cost structure and the revenue model (such as shifting inventory risk to *suppliers*, with knock-on effects on the labour rights of people who work for them).\n- AR 7. Impacts on the undertaking's *own workforce* that originate in the strategy or *business model* can also bring material *risks* to the undertaking. For example, risks arise if some people in the workforce are at risk of *forced labour*, and the undertaking is importing products into countries where the law allows for the confiscation of imported goods that are suspected of being made with forced labour. An example of *opportunities* for the undertaking may result from providing opportunities for the workforce such as job creation and upskilling in the context of a \"just transition\". Another example, in the context of a pandemic or other severe health crisis, relates to the undertaking potentially relying on contingent labour with little to no access to sick care and health benefitsthat may face severe operational and business continuity risks as workers have no choice but to keep working while sick, further exacerbating the spread of the disease and causing major *supply chain* breakdowns. Reputational and business opportunity risks linked to the exploitation of lowskilled, low-paid workers in sourcing geographies with minimal protectionsfor them are also increasing with media backlash and *consumer* preferences moving to more ethically sourced or sustainable goods.\n- AR 8. Examples of particular characteristics of people in the undertaking's *own workforce* that may be considered by the undertaking when responding to paragraph 15 relate to young people that may be more susceptible to *impacts* on their physical and mental development,\nor women in a context where women are routinely discriminated against in the terms and conditions of work, or migrants in a context where the market for the supply of labour is poorly regulated and workers are routinely charged recruitment fees. For some people in the workforce, the inherent nature of the activity that they are required to undertake may put them at risk (for example, people required to handle chemicals or operate certain equipment or low paid employees who are on \"zero hours\" contracts).\nAR 9. With regard to paragraph 16, material *risks* could also arise because of the undertaking's *dependency* on its *own workforce* where low-likelihood but high-impact events may trigger *financial effects;* for example, where a global pandemic leads to severe health impacts on the undertaking's workforce resulting in major disruptions to production and distribution. Other examples of risk related to the undertaking's dependency on its workforce include a shortage in skilled workers or political decisions or legislation affecting its own operations and *own workforce*.",

It may take time to understand negative impacts and how the undertaking may be involved with themthrough its value chain, as well as to identify appropriate responses and put them into practice. Therefore, the undertaking shall consider:\n\t- (a) its general and specific approaches to addressing material negative impacts;\n\t- (b) its social investment or other *development* programmes aimed at contributing to additional material positive impacts;\n\t- (c) how far it has progressed in its efforts during the reporting period; and\n\t- (d) its aims for continued improvement.\n- AR 26. Appropriate action can vary according to whether the undertaking causes or contributes to a material impact, or whether the material impact is directly linked to its own operations, products or services through a business relationship.\n- AR 27. Given that material negative impacts affecting communities that have occurred during the reporting period may also be linked to entities or operations outside its direct control, the undertaking may disclose whether and how it seeks to use its leverage in its business *relationships* to manage those impacts. This may include using commercial *leverage* (for example, enforcing contractual requirements with business relationships or implementing incentives), other forms of leverage within the relationship (such as providing *training* or capacity-building on the rights of indigenous peoples to entities with which the undertaking has a business relationships) or collaborative leverage with peers or other actors (such as initiatives aimed at minimising security-related impacts on communities or participating in company-community partnerships).\n- AR 28. Impacts on communities may stem from environmental matters which are disclosed by the undertaking under the ESRS E1 to E5. Examples include:\n\t- (a) ESRS E1 *Climate Change*: The implementation of *climate change mitigation* plans may require the undertaking to invest in *renewable energy* projects that may affect the lands, territories and *natural resources* of *indigenous peoples*. If the undertaking does not consult with the affected indigenous peoples , it could negatively impact the affected communities' right to *free, prior and informed consent*;\n\t- (b) ESRS E2 *Pollution*: The undertaking may negatively impact *affected communities* by failing to protect them from *pollution* from a particular production facility that causes them health-related issues;\n\t- (c) ESRS E3 *Water and marine sources*: The undertaking may negatively impact the access to clean drinking water of communities when withdrawing water in water stressed areas;\n\t- (d) ESRS E4 *Biodiversity and ecosystems*: The undertaking may negatively affect the livelihood of local farmers through operations that contaminate *soil*. Additional examples include the sealing of land through building new infrastructure, which can eradicate plant species that are critical for, for example, local *biodiversity* or to filter water for communities; or the introduction of *invasive species* (whether plants or animals)that can impact *ecosystems* and cause subsequent harm;\n\t- (e) ESRS E5 *Resource use and circular economy*: The undertaking may negatively impact the lives of communities by affecting their health through the mismanagement of *hazardous waste.*\nWhere the connection between environmental impacts and local communities is addressed in the disclosures within the Disclosure Requirements ESRS E1-E5, the undertaking may cross-referenceto those and clearly identify such disclosures.\n- AR 29. When the undertaking discloses its participation in an industry or multi-stakeholder initiative as part of its *actions* to address material negative impacts, the undertaking may disclose how the initiative, and its own involvement, is aiming to address the material impact concerned. It may disclose under ESRS S3-5 the relevant *targets* set by the initiative and progress towards them.\n- AR 30. When disclosing whether and how the undertaking considers actual and potential impacts on *affected communities* in decisions to terminate *business relationships* and whether and how it seeks to address any negative impacts that may result from termination, the undertaking may include examples.\n- AR 31. In disclosing how it tracks the effectiveness of *actions* to manage material impacts during the reporting period, the undertaking may disclose any lessons learned from the previous and current reporting periods.\n- AR 32. Processes used to track the effectiveness of *actions* can include internal or external auditing or verification, court proceedings and/or related court decisions, impact assessments, measurement systems, stakeholder feedback, *grievance mechanisms,* external performance ratings, and benchmarking.\n- AR 33. Reporting on effectiveness is aimed at enabling the understanding of the links between *actions* takenby an undertaking and the effective management of impacts.\n- AR 34. With regard to initiatives or processes whose primary aim is to deliver positive impacts for affected communities that are based on affected communities' needs, and with regard to progress in the implementation of such initiatives or processes, the undertaking may disclose:\n\t- (a) information about whether and how *affected communities* and *legitimate representatives* or their *credible proxies* play a role in decisions regarding the design and implementation of these investments or programmes; and\n\t- (b) information about the intended or achieved positive outcomes for *affected communities* ofthese investments or programmes.\n\t- (c) an explanation of the approximate scope of *affected communities* covered by the described social investment or *development* programmes, and, where applicable, the rationale for why selected communities were chosen for a given social investment or development programme's implementation.\n- AR 35. The undertaking may disclose whether any initiatives or processes whose primary aim is to deliver positive impacts for *affected communities* are designed also to support the achievement of one or more of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For example, through a commitment to advance UN SDG 5 to \"achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\" the undertakingmay be taking thoughtful measures to include women in the consultation process with an affected community to meet standards of effective *stakeholder engagement*, which can help empower the women in the process itself, but potentially also in their daily lives.\n- AR 36. When disclosing the intended or achieved positive outcomes of its *actions* for *affected communities* a distinction is to be made between evidence of certain activities having occurred (for example, that x number of women community members have been provided with *training* on how to become local*suppliers* to the undertaking) from evidence of actual outcomes for affected communities (for example, that x women community members have set up small businesses and have had their contracts with the undertaking renewed year-onyear).\n- AR 37. When disclosing whether initiatives or processes also play a role in mitigating material negative impacts, the undertaking may for example consider programmes that aim to improve local infrastructure surrounding an undertaking's operations, such as improvements in roads leading to a reduction in the number of severe traffic accidents involving community\nmembers.\n- AR 38. When disclosing the material risks and opportunities related to the undertaking's impacts or *dependencies* on affected communities, the undertaking may consider the following:\n\t- (a) risks related to the undertaking's impacts on *affected communities* may include the reputational or legal exposure, as well as operational risks, where affected communities protest against resettlements or the loss of access to lands, leading to costly delays, boycotts, or lawsuits;\n\t- (b) risks related to the undertaking's dependencies on *affected communities* may include disruption of business operations where *indigenous peoples* decide to withdraw their consent to a project on their lands, forcing the undertaking to significantly modify or abandon the project;\n\t- (c) business opportunities related to the undertaking's impacts on *affected communities*  may include more easily financing projects and being a partner of choice for communities, governments and other businesses; and\n\t- (d) opportunities related to the undertaking's dependencies on *affected communities*  may include the development of positive relationships between the undertaking and indigenous peoples that enable existing projects to expand with strong support.\n- AR 39. In disclosing the information in AR 41, the undertaking may consider explanations of risks and opportunities stemming from environmental impacts or *dependencies* (please refer to AR 31 for further details), including related human rights (or social) impacts. Examples include reputational risks stemming from the impact on the health of communities of unmanaged polluting *discharges*; or the *financial effects* of protests that may disrupt or interrupt an undertaking's activities, for example,in response to operations in water stressed areas that may impact the lives of affected communities.\n- AR 40. When disclosing whether *dependencies* turn into risks, the undertaking shall consider external developments.\n- AR 41. When disclosing policies, action and resources and *targets* related to the management of material risks and opportunities, in cases where risks and opportunities arise from a material impact, the undertaking may cross-reference its disclosures on policies, actions and resources and targets in relation to that impact.\n- AR 42. The undertaking shall consider whether and how its processes to manage material risks related to *affected communities* are integrated into its existing risk management processes.\n- AR 43.

In phase 1, to locate where there are areas at water risk, and areas where there is an interface with *marine resources* that could lead to material impacts and *dependencies* in its own operations and along its upstream and downstream value chain, the undertaking may consider:\n\t- (a) the locations of direct assets and operations and related upstream and downstream activities across the *value chain*;\n\t- (b) the *sites* located in *areas at water risk*, including areas of high-water stress; and\n\t- (c) the sectors or business units that are interfacing with water or marine resources in these priority locations.\n- AR 6. The undertaking shall consider river basins as the relevant level for assessment of locations and combine that approach with an operational risk assessment of its facilities and the facilities of *suppliers* with material impacts and risks.\n- AR 7. The undertaking shall consider the criteria for defining the status of water bodies according to the relevant Annexes of Directive 2000/60/EC (Water Framework Directive) as well as the guidance documents provided for implementation of the Water Framework Directive. The list of guidance documents can be accessed under the European Commission's Environment home page.\n- AR 8. In phase 2, to evaluate its impacts and *dependencies* for each priority location identified under AR 5, the undertaking may:\n\t- (a) identify business processes and activities that lead to impacts anddependencies on environmental assets and *ecosystem services*;\n\t- (b) identify water and *marine resources*-related impacts and dependencies across the undertaking's value chain; and\n\t- (c) assess the severity and likelihood of the positive and negative impacts onwater and marine resources.\n- AR 9. For the identification of water and *marine resources*-related *dependencies*, the undertaking may rely on international classifications such as the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES).\n- AR 10. When identifying its *marine resources*-related *dependencies*, the undertaking shall consider if it depends upon key marine resources-related commodities, including but not limited to gravels and seafood products.\n- AR 11. *Marine resources* are defined according to their use by human societies and must be considered in relation to the pressure they are subject to. Some of the pressure indicators are presented in other ESRS, namely microplastics and *emissions* to water in ESRS E2 and plastic *waste* in ESRS E5.\n- AR 12. Examples of *marine resources dependencies* which may be considered by the undertaking are:\n\t- (a) dependencies on commercially exploited fish and shellfish in its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain; and\n\t- (b) fishing activity that involves mobile bottom trawling, which can also have negative impacts on the seabed.\n- AR 13. In Phase 3, to assess its material *risks* and *opportunities* based on the results of Phases 1 and 2, the undertaking may :\n\t- (a) identify *transition risks* and *opportunities* in its own operations and its *value chain*  by the categories of:\n\t\t- i. *policy* and legal: e.g., introduction of regulation or policy (e.g., changes such as increased water protection, increased quality of water regulations, regulation of flows of water supply), ineffective governance of water bodies or *marine*\n*resources*, in particular across boundaries (e.g., transboundary governance and cooperation) resulting in water or oceans *degradation*, exposure to sanctions and litigation (e.g., non-respect of permits or allocations; negligence towards or killing of threatened marine species), enhanced reporting obligations on marine ecosystems and related services;\n- ii. technology: e.g., substitution of products or services by products or services with a lower impacton water and marine resources, transition to more efficient and cleaner technologies (i.e., with lower impacts on oceans and water), new monitoring technologies (e.g., satellite), water purification, flood protection;\n- iii. market: e.g., shifting supply, demand and financing, volatility or increased costs of water or marine resources;\n- iv. reputation: e.g., changing societal, customer or community perceptions as a result of an organisation's impact on water and marine resources; and\n- v. contribution to *systemic risks* via its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain, including the risks that a marineecosystem collapses or the risks that a critical natural system no longerfunctions (e.g., tipping points are reached, summing physical risks);\n- (b) identify physical risk including water quantity (*water scarcity*, water stress), water quality, infrastructure decay or unavailability of some marine resources-related commodities (e.g. the rarefaction of some species of fish or other underwater marine living organisms sold as products by the undertaking) leading for instance to the impossibility of running operations in certain geographical areas;\n- (c) identify opportunities categorised by:\n\t- i. resource efficiency: e.g., transition to more efficient services and processes requiring less water and marine resources;\n\t- ii. markets: e.g., development of less resource-intense products and services, diversification of business activities;\n\t- iii. financing: e.g., access to green funds, bonds or loans;\n\t- iv. resilience: e.g., diversification of marine or water resources and business activities (e.g., starting a new business unit on *ecosystem restoration*), investing in green infrastructures, *nature-based solutions*, adopting *recycling* and circularity mechanisms that reduce the *dependencies* on water or marine resources; and\n\t- v. reputation: positive *stakeholder engagement* as a result of a proactive stance on managing nature-related risks (e.g., leading to preferredpartner status).\n- AR 14. The undertaking may rely on primary, secondary or modelled data collection or other relevant approaches to assess material impacts, *dependencies*, risks and opportunities, including Commission Recommendation 2021/2279 on the use of the Environmental Footprint methods to measure and communicate the life cycle environmental performance of products and organisations (Annex I – Product Environmental Footprint; Annex III – Organisation Environmental Footprint).\n- AR 15. When providing information on the outcome of the *materiality* assessment, the undertaking shall consider:\n\t- (a) a list of geographical areas where water is a material issue for the undertaking'sown operations and its upstream and downstream value chain;\n\t- (b) a list of *marine resources*-related commodities used by the undertaking which are material to the good environmental status of marine waters as well as for the protection of marine resources; and\n\t- (c) a list of sectors or segments associated with water and marine resources material impacts, risks and opportunities.)",

                "[Context 13]: (*Objective*\n*Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-2 – Interests and views of stakeholders*\n*Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 – Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model*\n- AR 6. *Impacts* on the undertaking's *own workforce* can originate in its strategy or *business model* in a number of different ways. For example, impacts may relate to the undertaking's value proposition (such as providing lowest cost products or services, or high-speed delivery, in ways that put pressure on labour rights in its own operations), or its cost structure and the revenue model (such as shifting inventory risk to *suppliers*, with knock-on effects on the labour rights of people who work for them).\n- AR 7. Impacts on the undertaking's *own workforce* that originate in the strategy or *business model* can also bring material *risks* to the undertaking. For example, risks arise if some people in the workforce are at risk of *forced labour*, and the undertaking is importing products into countries where the law allows for the confiscation of imported goods that are suspected of being made with forced labour. An example of *opportunities* for the undertaking may result from providing opportunities for the workforce such as job creation and upskilling in the context of a \"just transition\". Another example, in the context of a pandemic or other severe health crisis, relates to the undertaking potentially relying on contingent labour with little to no access to sick care and health benefitsthat may face severe operational and business continuity risks as workers have no choice but to keep working while sick, further exacerbating the spread of the disease and causing major *supply chain* breakdowns. Reputational and business opportunity risks linked to the exploitation of lowskilled, low-paid workers in sourcing geographies with minimal protectionsfor them are also increasing with media backlash and *consumer* preferences moving to more ethically sourced or sustainable goods.\n- AR 8. Examples of particular characteristics of people in the undertaking's *own workforce* that may be considered by the undertaking when responding to paragraph 15 relate to young people that may be more susceptible to *impacts* on their physical and mental development,\nor women in a context where women are routinely discriminated against in the terms and conditions of work, or migrants in a context where the market for the supply of labour is poorly regulated and workers are routinely charged recruitment fees. For some people in the workforce, the inherent nature of the activity that they are required to undertake may put them at risk (for example, people required to handle chemicals or operate certain equipment or low paid employees who are on \"zero hours\" contracts).\nAR 9. With regard to paragraph 16, material *risks* could also arise because of the undertaking's *dependency* on its *own workforce* where low-likelihood but high-impact events may trigger *financial effects;* for example, where a global pandemic leads to severe health impacts on the undertaking's workforce resulting in major disruptions to production and distribution.

The cross-cutting standards ESRS 1 *General requirements* and ESRS 2 *General disclosures*  apply to the *sustainability matters* covered by topical standards and sector-specific standards.\n- 6. This standard (ESRS 1) describes the architecture of ESRS standards, explains drafting conventions and fundamental concepts, and sets out general requirements for preparing and presenting sustainability-related information.\n- 7. ESRS 2 establishes Disclosure Requirements on the information that the undertaking shall provide at a general level across all material *sustainability matters* on the reporting areas governance*,* strategy*, impact, risk* and *opportunity* management, and *metrics* and *targets*.\n- 8. Topical ESRS cover a sustainability topic and are structured into topics and sub-topics, and where necessary sub-sub-topics. The table in Application Requirement 16 (AR 16) to this standard provides an overview of the sustainability topics, sub-topics and sub-sub-topics (collectively '*sustainability matters*') covered by topical ESRS.\n- 9. Topical ESRS can include specific requirements that complement the general level Disclosure Requirements of ESRS 2. ESRS 2 Appendix C *Disclosure/Application Requirements in topical ESRS that are applicable jointly with ESRS 2 General Disclosures* provides a list of the additional requirements in topical ESRS that the undertaking shall apply in conjunction with the general level disclosure requirements of ESRS 2.\n- 10. Sector-specific standards are applicable to all undertakings within a sector. They address *impacts, risks* and *opportunities* that are likely to be material for all undertakings in a specific sector and that are not covered, or not sufficiently covered, by topical standards. Sector-specific standards are multi-topical and cover the topics that are most relevant to the sector in question. Sector-specific standards achieve a high degree of comparability.\n- 11. In addition to the disclosure requirements laid down in the three categories of ESRS, when an undertaking concludes that an impact, risk or opportunity is not covered or not covered with sufficient granularity by an ESRS but is material due to its specific facts and circumstances, it shall provide additional entity-specific disclosures to enable users to understand the undertaking's sustainability-related *impacts, risks* or *opportunities*. Application requirements AR 1 to AR 5 provide further guidance regarding entity-specific disclosures.)",

It may take time to understand negative impacts and how the undertaking may be involved with themthrough its value chain, as well as to identify appropriate responses and put them into practice. Therefore, the undertaking shall consider:\n\t- (a) its general and specific approaches to addressing material negative impacts;\n\t- (b) its social investment or other *development* programmes aimed at contributing to additional material positive impacts;\n\t- (c) how far it has progressed in its efforts during the reporting period; and\n\t- (d) its aims for continued improvement.\n- AR 26. Appropriate action can vary according to whether the undertaking causes or contributes to a material impact, or whether the material impact is directly linked to its own operations, products or services through a business relationship.\n- AR 27. Given that material negative impacts affecting communities that have occurred during the reporting period may also be linked to entities or operations outside its direct control, the undertaking may disclose whether and how it seeks to use its leverage in its business *relationships* to manage those impacts. This may include using commercial *leverage* (for example, enforcing contractual requirements with business relationships or implementing incentives), other forms of leverage within the relationship (such as providing *training* or capacity-building on the rights of indigenous peoples to entities with which the undertaking has a business relationships) or collaborative leverage with peers or other actors (such as initiatives aimed at minimising security-related impacts on communities or participating in company-community partnerships).\n- AR 28. Impacts on communities may stem from environmental matters which are disclosed by the undertaking under the ESRS E1 to E5. Examples include:\n\t- (a) ESRS E1 *Climate Change*: The implementation of *climate change mitigation* plans may require the undertaking to invest in *renewable energy* projects that may affect the lands, territories and *natural resources* of *indigenous peoples*. If the undertaking does not consult with the affected indigenous peoples , it could negatively impact the affected communities' right to *free, prior and informed consent*;\n\t- (b) ESRS E2 *Pollution*: The undertaking may negatively impact *affected communities* by failing to protect them from *pollution* from a particular production facility that causes them health-related issues;\n\t- (c) ESRS E3 *Water and marine sources*: The undertaking may negatively impact the access to clean drinking water of communities when withdrawing water in water stressed areas;\n\t- (d) ESRS E4 *Biodiversity and ecosystems*: The undertaking may negatively affect the livelihood of local farmers through operations that contaminate *soil*. Additional examples include the sealing of land through building new infrastructure, which can eradicate plant species that are critical for, for example, local *biodiversity* or to filter water for communities; or the introduction of *invasive species* (whether plants or animals)that can impact *ecosystems* and cause subsequent harm;\n\t- (e) ESRS E5 *Resource use and circular economy*: The undertaking may negatively impact the lives of communities by affecting their health through the mismanagement of *hazardous waste.*\nWhere the connection between environmental impacts and local communities is addressed in the disclosures within the Disclosure Requirements ESRS E1-E5, the undertaking may cross-referenceto those and clearly identify such disclosures.\n- AR 29. When the undertaking discloses its participation in an industry or multi-stakeholder initiative as part of its *actions* to address material negative impacts, the undertaking may disclose how the initiative, and its own involvement, is aiming to address the material impact concerned. It may disclose under ESRS S3-5 the relevant *targets* set by the initiative and progress towards them.\n- AR 30. When disclosing whether and how the undertaking considers actual and potential impacts on *affected communities* in decisions to terminate *business relationships* and whether and how it seeks to address any negative impacts that may result from termination, the undertaking may include examples.\n- AR 31. In disclosing how it tracks the effectiveness of *actions* to manage material impacts during the reporting period, the undertaking may disclose any lessons learned from the previous and current reporting periods.\n- AR 32. Processes used to track the effectiveness of *actions* can include internal or external auditing or verification, court proceedings and/or related court decisions, impact assessments, measurement systems, stakeholder feedback, *grievance mechanisms,* external performance ratings, and benchmarking.\n- AR 33. Reporting on effectiveness is aimed at enabling the understanding of the links between *actions* takenby an undertaking and the effective management of impacts.\n- AR 34. With regard to initiatives or processes whose primary aim is to deliver positive impacts for affected communities that are based on affected communities' needs, and with regard to progress in the implementation of such initiatives or processes, the undertaking may disclose:\n\t- (a) information about whether and how *affected communities* and *legitimate representatives* or their *credible proxies* play a role in decisions regarding the design and implementation of these investments or programmes; and\n\t- (b) information about the intended or achieved positive outcomes for *affected communities* ofthese investments or programmes.\n\t- (c) an explanation of the approximate scope of *affected communities* covered by the described social investment or *development* programmes, and, where applicable, the rationale for why selected communities were chosen for a given social investment or development programme's implementation.\n- AR 35. The undertaking may disclose whether any initiatives or processes whose primary aim is to deliver positive impacts for *affected communities* are designed also to support the achievement of one or more of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For example, through a commitment to advance UN SDG 5 to \"achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\" the undertakingmay be taking thoughtful measures to include women in the consultation process with an affected community to meet standards of effective *stakeholder engagement*, which can help empower the women in the process itself, but potentially also in their daily lives.\n- AR 36. When disclosing the intended or achieved positive outcomes of its *actions* for *affected communities* a distinction is to be made between evidence of certain activities having occurred (for example, that x number of women community members have been provided with *training* on how to become local*suppliers* to the undertaking) from evidence of actual outcomes for affected communities (for example, that x women community members have set up small businesses and have had their contracts with the undertaking renewed year-onyear).\n- AR 37. When disclosing whether initiatives or processes also play a role in mitigating material negative impacts, the undertaking may for example consider programmes that aim to improve local infrastructure surrounding an undertaking's operations, such as improvements in roads leading to a reduction in the number of severe traffic accidents involving community\nmembers.\n- AR 38. When disclosing the material risks and opportunities related to the undertaking's impacts or *dependencies* on affected communities, the undertaking may consider the following:\n\t- (a) risks related to the undertaking's impacts on *affected communities* may include the reputational or legal exposure, as well as operational risks, where affected communities protest against resettlements or the loss of access to lands, leading to costly delays, boycotts, or lawsuits;\n\t- (b) risks related to the undertaking's dependencies on *affected communities* may include disruption of business operations where *indigenous peoples* decide to withdraw their consent to a project on their lands, forcing the undertaking to significantly modify or abandon the project;\n\t- (c) business opportunities related to the undertaking's impacts on *affected communities*  may include more easily financing projects and being a partner of choice for communities, governments and other businesses; and\n\t- (d) opportunities related to the undertaking's dependencies on *affected communities*  may include the development of positive relationships between the undertaking and indigenous peoples that enable existing projects to expand with strong support.\n- AR 39. In disclosing the information in AR 41, the undertaking may consider explanations of risks and opportunities stemming from environmental impacts or *dependencies* (please refer to AR 31 for further details), including related human rights (or social) impacts. Examples include reputational risks stemming from the impact on the health of communities of unmanaged polluting *discharges*; or the *financial effects* of protests that may disrupt or interrupt an undertaking's activities, for example,in response to operations in water stressed areas that may impact the lives of affected communities.\n- AR 40. When disclosing whether *dependencies* turn into risks, the undertaking shall consider external developments.\n- AR 41. When disclosing policies, action and resources and *targets* related to the management of material risks and opportunities, in cases where risks and opportunities arise from a material impact, the undertaking may cross-reference its disclosures on policies, actions and resources and targets in relation to that impact.\n- AR 42. The undertaking shall consider whether and how its processes to manage material risks related to *affected communities* are integrated into its existing risk management processes.\n- AR 43. When disclosing the resources allocated to the management of material impacts, the undertaking may disclose which internal functions are involved in managing the impacts and what types of action they take to address negative and advance positive impacts.)",

This ESRS sets out the disclosure requirements that apply to all undertakings regardless of their sector of activity (i.e., sector agnostic) and apply across sustainability topics (i.e., crosscutting). This ESRS covers the reporting areas defined in ESRS 1 *General requirements* section 1.2 *Cross-Cutting Standards and reporting areas*.\n- 2. In the preparation of disclosures under this Standard, the undertaking shall apply the Disclosure Requirements (including their datapoints) set in topical ESRS, as listed in Appendix C of this Standard *Disclosure/Application Requirements in topical ESRS that are applicable jointly with ESRS 2 General Disclosures*. The undertaking shall apply the requirements listed in Appendix C:\n\t- (a) in all instances for the requirements in topical standards related to Disclosure Requirement IRO-1 *Description of the processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities*; and\n\t- (b) for all other requirements listed in appendix C, only if the sustainability topic is material based on the undertaking's *materiality* assessment (see ESRS 1 chapter 3 *Double materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures*).",

It refers both to actual impacts and to potential future impacts.\n\t- (b) The term \"*risks* and *opportunities*\" refers to the undertaking's sustainability-related financial risks and opportunities, including those deriving from dependencies on natural, human and social resources, as identified through a *financial materiality* assessment (see section 3.5).\nCollectively, these are referred to as \"impacts, risks and opportunities\" (IROs). They reflect the *double materiality* perspective of ESRS described in section 3.\n- 15.

Application Requirements support the application of Disclosure Requirements and have the same authority as other parts of an ESRS.\n- 18. ESRS use the following terms to distinguish between different degrees of obligation on the undertaking to disclose information:\n\t- (a) \"shall disclose\" indicates that the provision is prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement or datapoint;\n\t- (b) \"may disclose\" indicates voluntary disclosure to encourage good practice.\nIn addition, ESRS use the term \"shall consider\" when referring to issues, resources or methodologies that the undertaking is expected to take into account or to use in the preparation of a given disclosure if applicable.",

Categories of ESRS Standards, reporting areas and drafting conventions* *1.1 Categories of ESRS standards*\n- 4. There are three categories of ESRS:\n\t- (a) cross-cutting standards;\n\t- (b) topical standards (Environmental, Social and Governance standards); and\n\t- (c) sector-specific standards.\nCross-cutting standards and topical standards are sector-agnostic, meaning that they apply to all undertakings regardless of which sector or sectors the undertaking operates in.\n- 5. The cross-cutting standards ESRS 1 *General requirements* and ESRS 2 *General disclosures*  apply to the *sustainability matters* covered by topical standards and sector-specific standards.\n- 6. This standard (ESRS 1) describes the architecture of ESRS standards, explains drafting conventions and fundamental concepts, and sets out general requirements for preparing and presenting sustainability-related information.\n- 7. ESRS 2 establishes Disclosure Requirements on the information that the undertaking shall provide at a general level across all material *sustainability matters* on the reporting areas governance*,* strategy*, impact, risk* and *opportunity* management, and *metrics* and *targets*.\n- 8. Topical ESRS cover a sustainability topic and are structured into topics and sub-topics, and where necessary sub-sub-topics. The table in Application Requirement 16 (AR 16) to this standard provides an overview of the sustainability topics, sub-topics and sub-sub-topics (collectively '*sustainability matters*') covered by topical ESRS.\n- 9. Topical ESRS can include specific requirements that complement the general level Disclosure Requirements of ESRS 2. ESRS 2 Appendix C *Disclosure/Application Requirements in topical ESRS that are applicable jointly with ESRS 2 General Disclosures* provides a list of the additional requirements in topical ESRS that the undertaking shall apply in conjunction with the general level disclosure requirements of ESRS 2.\n- 10. Sector-specific standards are applicable to all undertakings within a sector. They address *impacts, risks* and *opportunities* that are likely to be material for all undertakings in a specific sector and that are not covered, or not sufficiently covered, by topical standards. Sector-specific standards are multi-topical and cover the topics that are most relevant to the sector in question. Sector-specific standards achieve a high degree of comparability.\n- 11. In addition to the disclosure requirements laid down in the three categories of ESRS, when an undertaking concludes that an impact, risk or opportunity is not covered or not covered with sufficient granularity by an ESRS but is material due to its specific facts and circumstances, it shall provide additional entity-specific disclosures to enable users to understand the undertaking's sustainability-related *impacts, risks* or *opportunities*.

It refers both to actual impacts and to potential future impacts.\n\t- (b) The term \"*risks* and *opportunities*\" refers to the undertaking's sustainability-related financial risks and opportunities, including those deriving from dependencies on natural, human and social resources, as identified through a *financial materiality* assessment (see section 3.5).\nCollectively, these are referred to as \"impacts, risks and opportunities\" (IROs). They reflect the *double materiality* perspective of ESRS described in section 3.\n- 15. Throughout ESRS, the terms that are defined in the glossary of definitions (Annex II) are put in *bold italic*, except when a defined term is used more than once in the same paragraph.\n- 16.

Application Requirements support the application of Disclosure Requirements and have the same authority as other parts of an ESRS.\n- 18. ESRS use the following terms to distinguish between different degrees of obligation on the undertaking to disclose information:\n\t- (a) \"shall disclose\" indicates that the provision is prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement or datapoint;\n\t- (b) \"may disclose\" indicates voluntary disclosure to encourage good practice.\nIn addition, ESRS use the term \"shall consider\" when referring to issues, resources or methodologies that the undertaking is expected to take into account or to use in the preparation of a given disclosure if applicable.",

Categories of ESRS Standards, reporting areas and drafting conventions* *1.1 Categories of ESRS standards*\n- 4. There are three categories of ESRS:\n\t- (a) cross-cutting standards;\n\t- (b) topical standards (Environmental, Social and Governance standards); and\n\t- (c) sector-specific standards.\nCross-cutting standards and topical standards are sector-agnostic, meaning that they apply to all undertakings regardless of which sector or sectors the undertaking operates in.\n- 5. The cross-cutting standards ESRS 1 *General requirements* and ESRS 2 *General disclosures*  apply to the *sustainability matters* covered by topical standards and sector-specific standards.\n- 6. This standard (ESRS 1) describes the architecture of ESRS standards, explains drafting conventions and fundamental concepts, and sets out general requirements for preparing and presenting sustainability-related information.\n- 7. ESRS 2 establishes Disclosure Requirements on the information that the undertaking shall provide at a general level across all material *sustainability matters* on the reporting areas governance*,* strategy*, impact, risk* and *opportunity* management, and *metrics* and *targets*.\n- 8. Topical ESRS cover a sustainability topic and are structured into topics and sub-topics, and where necessary sub-sub-topics. The table in Application Requirement 16 (AR 16) to this standard provides an overview of the sustainability topics, sub-topics and sub-sub-topics (collectively '*sustainability matters*') covered by topical ESRS.\n- 9. Topical ESRS can include specific requirements that complement the general level Disclosure Requirements of ESRS 2. ESRS 2 Appendix C *Disclosure/Application Requirements in topical ESRS that are applicable jointly with ESRS 2 General Disclosures* provides a list of the additional requirements in topical ESRS that the undertaking shall apply in conjunction with the general level disclosure requirements of ESRS 2.\n- 10. Sector-specific standards are applicable to all undertakings within a sector. They address *impacts, risks* and *opportunities* that are likely to be material for all undertakings in a specific sector and that are not covered, or not sufficiently covered, by topical standards. Sector-specific standards are multi-topical and cover the topics that are most relevant to the sector in question. Sector-specific standards achieve a high degree of comparability.\n- 11. In addition to the disclosure requirements laid down in the three categories of ESRS, when an undertaking concludes that an impact, risk or opportunity is not covered or not covered with sufficient granularity by an ESRS but is material due to its specific facts and circumstances, it shall provide additional entity-specific disclosures to enable users to understand the undertaking's sustainability-related *impacts, risks* or *opportunities*.

Categories of ESRS Standards, reporting areas and drafting conventions* *1.1 Categories of ESRS standards*\n- 4. There are three categories of ESRS:\n\t- (a) cross-cutting standards;\n\t- (b) topical standards (Environmental, Social and Governance standards); and\n\t- (c) sector-specific standards.\nCross-cutting standards and topical standards are sector-agnostic, meaning that they apply to all undertakings regardless of which sector or sectors the undertaking operates in.\n- 5. The cross-cutting standards ESRS 1 *General requirements* and ESRS 2 *General disclosures*  apply to the *sustainability matters* covered by topical standards and sector-specific standards.\n- 6. This standard (ESRS 1) describes the architecture of ESRS standards, explains drafting conventions and fundamental concepts, and sets out general requirements for preparing and presenting sustainability-related information.\n- 7. ESRS 2 establishes Disclosure Requirements on the information that the undertaking shall provide at a general level across all material *sustainability matters* on the reporting areas governance*,* strategy*, impact, risk* and *opportunity* management, and *metrics* and *targets*.\n- 8. Topical ESRS cover a sustainability topic and are structured into topics and sub-topics, and where necessary sub-sub-topics. The table in Application Requirement 16 (AR 16) to this standard provides an overview of the sustainability topics, sub-topics and sub-sub-topics (collectively '*sustainability matters*') covered by topical ESRS.\n- 9. Topical ESRS can include specific requirements that complement the general level Disclosure Requirements of ESRS 2. ESRS 2 Appendix C *Disclosure/Application Requirements in topical ESRS that are applicable jointly with ESRS 2 General Disclosures* provides a list of the additional requirements in topical ESRS that the undertaking shall apply in conjunction with the general level disclosure requirements of ESRS 2.\n- 10. Sector-specific standards are applicable to all undertakings within a sector. They address *impacts, risks* and *opportunities* that are likely to be material for all undertakings in a specific sector and that are not covered, or not sufficiently covered, by topical standards. Sector-specific standards are multi-topical and cover the topics that are most relevant to the sector in question. Sector-specific standards achieve a high degree of comparability.\n- 11. In addition to the disclosure requirements laid down in the three categories of ESRS, when an undertaking concludes that an impact, risk or opportunity is not covered or not covered with sufficient granularity by an ESRS but is material due to its specific facts and circumstances, it shall provide additional entity-specific disclosures to enable users to understand the undertaking's sustainability-related *impacts, risks* or *opportunities*. Application requirements AR 1 to AR 5 provide further guidance regarding entity-specific disclosures.)"

        "question": "Link the topics, subtopics, and sub-subtopics from AR16 to the reporting requirements of standard S1, and provide a detailed explanation of how they correspond.",
        "response": "To link the topics, subtopics, and sub-subtopics from AR16 to the reporting requirements of standard S1, we need to understand the thematic connections between the materiality assessment framework outlined in AR16 and the social disclosure requirements specified in standard S1. Here's a detailed explanation of how they correspond, with contextual references preserved and disambiguated:\n\n**AR16 Topics, Subtopics, and Sub-subtopics:**\n\n1. **Topic: Impact, risk, and opportunity management** [Answer 1, Context 16]\n   - **Disclosure Requirement S3-4**: This involves taking action on material impacts on affected communities, managing material risks, and pursuing material opportunities related to affected communities. It includes considerations for understanding and addressing negative impacts, leveraging business relationships, and tracking the effectiveness of actions. [Answer 1, Context 16]\n\n2. **Subtopics and Sub-subtopics**:\n   - **Material Risks and Opportunities**: These include risks related to impacts and dependencies on communities, opportunities related to impacts and dependencies, and the integration of processes to manage material risks into existing risk management processes. [Answer 1, Context 16]\n\n**Standard S1 Reporting Requirements:**\n\n1. **Disclosure Requirements**: Standard S1 focuses on social aspects within an undertaking, including collective bargaining coverage, social dialogue, social protection, percentage of employees with disabilities, training and skills development, health and safety, and work-life balance. [Answer 2, Context 3]\n\n**Correspondence Explanation:**\n\n- **Impact, Risk, and Opportunity Management**: The overarching theme of AR16 aligns with the social disclosure requirements of standard S1, as both emphasize the management of impacts, risks, and opportunities. Standard S1's focus on social aspects such as collective bargaining, social protection, and work-life balance can be seen as specific applications of managing social impacts and opportunities within the workforce and affected communities. [Answer 1, Context 16] [Answer 2, Context 3]\n\n- **Material Risks and Opportunities**: The subtopics in AR16 related to material risks and opportunities correspond to the reporting requirements in standard S1 that address social risks and opportunities. For instance, the management of risks related to workforce dependencies and the opportunities for improving social conditions through training and skills development are directly relevant to the disclosure requirements in standard S1. [Answer 1, Context 16] [Answer 2, Context 3]\n\n- **Tracking Effectiveness and Integration**: AR16's emphasis on tracking the effectiveness of actions and integrating risk management processes is mirrored in standard S1's requirements for reporting on health and safety, training, and skills development. These elements ensure that undertakings are not only identifying social impacts but also actively managing and improving them. [Answer 1, Context 16] [Answer 2, Context 3]\n\nIn summary, the topics, subtopics, and sub-subtopics from AR16 provide a framework for assessing and managing impacts, risks, and opportunities, which correspond to the social disclosure requirements of standard S1. Both sets of requirements aim to ensure that undertakings address material social impacts and opportunities effectively, with a focus on transparency and continuous improvement."
