This Disclosure Requirement covers all *employees* who perform work for any of the undertaking's entities included in its sustainability reporting.\n- AR 54. Providing a breakdown of *employees* by country gives insight into the distribution of activity across countries. The number of employees in each country is also a key trigger for many information, consultation and participation rights for workers and workers' representatives, both in the Union labour law acquis (for example, Directive 2009/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <sup>108</sup> \"European Works Councils Directive\" and Directive 2002/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council<sup>109</sup> \"Information and Consultation Directive\") and in national law (for example, rights to establish a works council or to have board level employee representation). Providing a breakdown of employees by gender and type of employment relationship gives insight into gender representation across the undertaking. Additionally, providing a breakdown of employees by region gives insight into regional variations. A region can refer to a country or other geographic locations, such as a region within a country or a world region.\n- AR 55. The undertaking shall disclose the requested disclosures in the following tabular formats:\nTable 1: Template for presenting information on employee head count by gender\n <sup>108</sup> Directive 2009/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 on the establishment of a European Works Council or a procedure in Community-scale undertakings and Community-scale groups of undertakings for the purposes of informing and consulting employees (OJ L 122, 16.5.2009, p. 28).\n<sup>109</sup> Directive 2002/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2002 establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community - Joint declaration of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on employee representation (OJ L 80, 23.3.2002, p. 29).\n| Gender       | Number of employees (head<br>count) |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------|\n|              |                                     |\n| Male         |                                     |\n| Female       |                                     |\n| Other        |                                     |\n| Not reported |                                     |\n| Total        |                                     |\n| Employees    |                                     |\nIn some Member States it is possible for persons to legally register themselves as having a third, often neutral, gender, which is categorised as \"other\" in the table above.

The definitions of permanent, temporary, non-guaranteed hours, full-time, and part-time *employees* differ between countries. If the undertaking has employees in more than one country, it shall use the definitions as per the national laws of the countries where the employees are based to calculate country-level data. The country-level data shall then be added up to calculate total numbers, disregarding differences in national legal definitions. Non-guaranteed hours employees are employed by the undertaking without a guarantee of a minimum or fixed number of working hours. The employee may need to make themselves available for work as required, but the undertaking is not contractually obliged to offer the employee a minimum or fixed number of working hours per day, week, or month. Casual employees, employees with zero-hour contracts, and on-call employees are examples that fallunder this category.\n- AR 57. Disclosing the number of *employees* at the end of the reporting period provides information forthat point in time, without capturing fluctuations during the reporting period. Disclosing these numbers in averages across the reporting period takes into account fluctuations during the reporting period.\n- AR 58. Quantitative data, such as the number of temporary or part-time *employees*, is unlikely to be sufficient on its own. For example, a high proportion of temporary or part-time employees could indicate a lack of employment security for employees, but it could equally signal workplace flexibility when offered as a voluntary choice. For this reason, the undertaking is required to disclose contextual information to help information *users*  interpret the data. The undertaking can explain the reasons for temporary employment. An example of such a reason is the recruitment of employees to undertake work on a temporary or seasonal project or event. Another example is the standard practice of offering a temporary contract (for example, six months) to new employees before an offer of permanent employment is made. The undertaking may also explain the reasons for nonguaranteed hours employment.\n- AR 59. For the own employee turnover calculation, the undertaking shall calculate the aggregate of the number of *employees* who leave voluntarily or due to dismissal, retirement, or death in service. The undertaking shall use this number for the numerator of the employee turnover rate and may determine the denominator used to calculate this rate and describe its methodology.\n- AR 60. Where data is not available for detailed information, the undertaking shall use an estimation of the employee number or ratios, in accordance with ESRS 1, and clearly identify where theuse of estimates has taken place.",

This disclosure covers both individual contractors supplying labour to the undertaking (\"self-employed people\") and workers provided by\nundertakings primarily engaged in \"employment activities\" (NACE Code N78). If all the people performing work for the undertaking are *employees* and the undertaking does not have any people in its workforce who are not employees, this Disclosure Requirement is not material for the undertaking; notwithstanding,the undertaking may state this fact when disclosing the information required by Disclosure Requirement S1-6 as contextual information as this information can be relevant for the *users* of the *Sustainability Statement*.\n- AR 62. Examples of contractors (self-employed people) in the undertaking's *own workforce*  include: contractors hired by the undertaking to perform work that would otherwise be carried out by an employee; contractors hired by the undertaking to perform work in a public area (for example, on a road, on the street); and contractors hired by the undertaking to deliver the work/service directly at the workplace of a client of the organization. Examples of people employed by a third party engaged in 'employment activities' whose work is under the direction of the undertaking include: people who perform the same work that *employees* carry out, such as people whofill in for employees who are temporarily absent (due to illness, holiday, parental leave, etc.); people performing regular work at the same *site* as employees; and workers who are dispatched temporarily from another EU member state to work for the undertaking ('posted workers'). Examples of *value chain workers* (and thus of workers not in the undertaking's own workforce and reported under the scope of ESRS S2) include: workers for a *supplier* contracted by the undertaking who work on the supplier's premises using the supplier's work methods; workersfor a 'downstream' entity which purchases goods or services from the undertaking; and workers of an equipment supplier to the undertaking who, at one or more of the undertaking's workplaces, perform regular maintenance on the supplier's equipment (for example, photocopier) as stipulated in the contract between the equipment supplier and the undertaking.\n- AR 63.

The undertaking may also disclose the reasons for the fluctuations. For example, an increase in the number of non-employees during the reporting period could be due to a seasonal event. Conversely, a decrease in the number of non-employees compared to the previous reporting period could be due to the completion of a temporary project.

Fatalities may be reported separately for those resulting from *work-related injuries* and thoseresulting from *work-related ill health*.\nGuidance on \"work-related\"\nAR 83. *Work-related injuries* and *work-related ill health* arise from exposure to hazards at work. Notwithstanding, other types of *incidents* can occur that are not connected with the work itself.For example, the following incidents are generally not considered to be work-related, unless otherwise specified in applicable national legislation:\n- (a) a person in the workforce suffers a heart attack while at work that it is not connected with work;\n- (b) a person in the workforce driving to or from work is injured in a car accident (when driving is not partof the work and where the transport has not been organised by the undertaking); and\n- (c) a person in the workforce with epilepsy has a seizure at work that is not connected with work.\n- AR 84. With regard to travelling for work purposes, injuries and ill health that occur while a person is travelling are work-related if, at the time of the injury or ill health, the person was engaged in work activities \"in the interest of the employer\". Examples of such activities include travelling to and from customer contacts; conducting job tasks; and entertaining or being entertained to transact, discuss, or promote business (at the direction of the employer). If the undertaking isresponsible for the transport commuting, *incidents* occurred while commuting are considered to be work-related. Nonetheless, incidents which arise during travel, outside of the undertaking's responsibility (i.e., regular commuting to and from work), may be reported separately provided that the undertaking has such data available across the undertaking.\n- AR 85. With regard to working from home, injuries and ill health that occur when working from home are work-related, if the injury or ill health occurs while the person is performing work from home; and the injury or ill health is directly related to the performance of work rather than thegeneral home environment or setting.\n- AR 86. With regard to mental illness, it is considered to be work-related, if it has been notified voluntarily by the person concerned and it is supported by an opinion from a licensed healthcare professional with appropriate *training* and experience; and if such opinion states that the illness is work-related.\n- AR 87. Health issues resulting, for example, from smoking, drug and alcohol abuse, physical inactivity, unhealthy diets, and psychosocial factors unrelated to work are not considered work-related.\n- AR 88. Occupational diseases are not considered *work-related injuries* but are covered under *work-related ill health.*\nGuidance on computing the rate of work-related injuries\n- AR 89. In computing the rate of work-related injuries, the undertaking shall divide the respective number of cases by the number of total hours worked by people in its *own workforce* and multiplied by 1,000,000. Thereby, these rates represent the number of respective cases per one million hours worked. A rate based on 1,000,000 hours worked indicates the number of work-related injuries per 500 full time people in the workforce over a 1-year timeframe. For comparability purposes a rate based on 1,000,000 hours worked shall be used also for undertakings with less than 500 people in the workforce.\n- AR 90. If the undertaking cannot directly calculate the number of hours worked, it may estimate this on the basis of normal or standard hours of work, taking into account entitlements to periods of paid leave of absence from work (for example, paid vacations, paid sick leave, public holidays) and explain this in its disclosures.\n- AR 91. An undertaking shall include fatalities as a result of work-related injury in the calculation of thenumber and rate of recordable work-related injuries.\nGuidance on recordable work-related ill health\nAR 92. Work-related ill health can include acute, recurring, and chronic health problems caused or aggravated by work conditions or practices. These include musculoskeletal disorders, skin and respiratory diseases, malignant cancers, diseases caused by physical agents (for example, noise-induced hearing loss, vibration-caused diseases), and mental illnesses (for example, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder). For the purpose of the required disclosures, the undertaking shall, at a minimum, include in its disclosure those cases outlined in the ILO List of Occupational Diseases.\n- AR 93. In the context of this Standard, work-related musculoskeletal disorders are covered under work-related ill health (and not injuries).\n- AR 94. The cases to be disclosed in paragraph 88(d) relate to cases of work-related ill health notified to the undertaking or identified by the undertaking through medical surveillance, during the reporting period. The undertaking might be notified of cases of work-related ill health through reports by affected people, compensation agencies, or healthcare professionals. The disclosure may include cases of work-related ill health that were detected during the reportingperiod among people who were formerly in the undertaking's workforce.\nGuidance on the number of days lost\nAR 95. The undertaking shall count the number of days lost such that the first full day and last dayof absence shall be included. Calendar days should be considered for the calculation, thus days on which the affected individual is not scheduled for work (for example, weekends, public holidays) will count as lost days.",

The definitions of permanent, temporary, non-guaranteed hours, full-time, and part-time *employees* differ between countries. If the undertaking has employees in more than one country, it shall use the definitions as per the national laws of the countries where the employees are based to calculate country-level data. The country-level data shall then be added up to calculate total numbers, disregarding differences in national legal definitions. Non-guaranteed hours employees are employed by the undertaking without a guarantee of a minimum or fixed number of working hours. The employee may need to make themselves available for work as required, but the undertaking is not contractually obliged to offer the employee a minimum or fixed number of working hours per day, week, or month. Casual employees, employees with zero-hour contracts, and on-call employees are examples that fallunder this category.\n- AR 57. Disclosing the number of *employees* at the end of the reporting period provides information forthat point in time, without capturing fluctuations during the reporting period. Disclosing these numbers in averages across the reporting period takes into account fluctuations during the reporting period.\n- AR 58. Quantitative data, such as the number of temporary or part-time *employees*, is unlikely to be sufficient on its own. For example, a high proportion of temporary or part-time employees could indicate a lack of employment security for employees, but it could equally signal workplace flexibility when offered as a voluntary choice. For this reason, the undertaking is required to disclose contextual information to help information *users*  interpret the data. The undertaking can explain the reasons for temporary employment. An example of such a reason is the recruitment of employees to undertake work on a temporary or seasonal project or event. Another example is the standard practice of offering a temporary contract (for example, six months) to new employees before an offer of permanent employment is made. The undertaking may also explain the reasons for nonguaranteed hours employment.\n- AR 59. For the own employee turnover calculation, the undertaking shall calculate the aggregate of the number of *employees* who leave voluntarily or due to dismissal, retirement, or death in service. The undertaking shall use this number for the numerator of the employee turnover rate and may determine the denominator used to calculate this rate and describe its methodology.\n- AR 60. Where data is not available for detailed information, the undertaking shall use an estimation of the employee number or ratios, in accordance with ESRS 1, and clearly identify where theuse of estimates has taken place.",

This Disclosure Requirement provides insight into the undertaking's approach to employment, as well as the scope and nature of impacts arising from its employment practices. It also provides contextual information that aids an understanding of the information reported in otherdisclosures. This disclosure covers both individual contractors supplying labour to the undertaking (\"self-employed people\") and workers provided by\nundertakings primarily engaged in \"employment activities\" (NACE Code N78). If all the people performing work for the undertaking are *employees* and the undertaking does not have any people in its workforce who are not employees, this Disclosure Requirement is not material for the undertaking; notwithstanding,the undertaking may state this fact when disclosing the information required by Disclosure Requirement S1-6 as contextual information as this information can be relevant for the *users* of the *Sustainability Statement*.\n- AR 62. Examples of contractors (self-employed people) in the undertaking's *own workforce*  include: contractors hired by the undertaking to perform work that would otherwise be carried out by an employee; contractors hired by the undertaking to perform work in a public area (for example, on a road, on the street); and contractors hired by the undertaking to deliver the work/service directly at the workplace of a client of the organization. Examples of people employed by a third party engaged in 'employment activities' whose work is under the direction of the undertaking include: people who perform the same work that *employees* carry out, such as people whofill in for employees who are temporarily absent (due to illness, holiday, parental leave, etc.); people performing regular work at the same *site* as employees; and workers who are dispatched temporarily from another EU member state to work for the undertaking ('posted workers'). Examples of *value chain workers* (and thus of workers not in the undertaking's own workforce and reported under the scope of ESRS S2) include: workers for a *supplier* contracted by the undertaking who work on the supplier's premises using the supplier's work methods; workersfor a 'downstream' entity which purchases goods or services from the undertaking; and workers of an equipment supplier to the undertaking who, at one or more of the undertaking's workplaces, perform regular maintenance on the supplier's equipment (for example, photocopier) as stipulated in the contract between the equipment supplier and the undertaking.\n- AR 63.

The undertaking may also disclose the reasons for the fluctuations. For example, an increase in the number of non-employees during the reporting period could be due to a seasonal event. Conversely, a decrease in the number of non-employees compared to the previous reporting period could be due to the completion of a temporary project. If the undertaking discloses fluctuations, it shall also explain the criteria used to determine which fluctuations it discloses.

Fatalities may be reported separately for those resulting from *work-related injuries* and thoseresulting from *work-related ill health*.\nGuidance on \"work-related\"\nAR 83. *Work-related injuries* and *work-related ill health* arise from exposure to hazards at work. Notwithstanding, other types of *incidents* can occur that are not connected with the work itself.For example, the following incidents are generally not considered to be work-related, unless otherwise specified in applicable national legislation:\n- (a) a person in the workforce suffers a heart attack while at work that it is not connected with work;\n- (b) a person in the workforce driving to or from work is injured in a car accident (when driving is not partof the work and where the transport has not been organised by the undertaking); and\n- (c) a person in the workforce with epilepsy has a seizure at work that is not connected with work.\n- AR 84. With regard to travelling for work purposes, injuries and ill health that occur while a person is travelling are work-related if, at the time of the injury or ill health, the person was engaged in work activities \"in the interest of the employer\". Examples of such activities include travelling to and from customer contacts; conducting job tasks; and entertaining or being entertained to transact, discuss, or promote business (at the direction of the employer). If the undertaking isresponsible for the transport commuting, *incidents* occurred while commuting are considered to be work-related. Nonetheless, incidents which arise during travel, outside of the undertaking's responsibility (i.e., regular commuting to and from work), may be reported separately provided that the undertaking has such data available across the undertaking.\n- AR 85. With regard to working from home, injuries and ill health that occur when working from home are work-related, if the injury or ill health occurs while the person is performing work from home; and the injury or ill health is directly related to the performance of work rather than thegeneral home environment or setting.\n- AR 86. With regard to mental illness, it is considered to be work-related, if it has been notified voluntarily by the person concerned and it is supported by an opinion from a licensed healthcare professional with appropriate *training* and experience; and if such opinion states that the illness is work-related.\n- AR 87. Health issues resulting, for example, from smoking, drug and alcohol abuse, physical inactivity, unhealthy diets, and psychosocial factors unrelated to work are not considered work-related.\n- AR 88. Occupational diseases are not considered *work-related injuries* but are covered under *work-related ill health.*\nGuidance on computing the rate of work-related injuries\n- AR 89. In computing the rate of work-related injuries, the undertaking shall divide the respective number of cases by the number of total hours worked by people in its *own workforce* and multiplied by 1,000,000. Thereby, these rates represent the number of respective cases per one million hours worked. A rate based on 1,000,000 hours worked indicates the number of work-related injuries per 500 full time people in the workforce over a 1-year timeframe. For comparability purposes a rate based on 1,000,000 hours worked shall be used also for undertakings with less than 500 people in the workforce.\n- AR 90. If the undertaking cannot directly calculate the number of hours worked, it may estimate this on the basis of normal or standard hours of work, taking into account entitlements to periods of paid leave of absence from work (for example, paid vacations, paid sick leave, public holidays) and explain this in its disclosures.\n- AR 91. An undertaking shall include fatalities as a result of work-related injury in the calculation of thenumber and rate of recordable work-related injuries.\nGuidance on recordable work-related ill health\nAR 92. Work-related ill health can include acute, recurring, and chronic health problems caused or aggravated by work conditions or practices. These include musculoskeletal disorders, skin and respiratory diseases, malignant cancers, diseases caused by physical agents (for example, noise-induced hearing loss, vibration-caused diseases), and mental illnesses (for example, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder). For the purpose of the required disclosures, the undertaking shall, at a minimum, include in its disclosure those cases outlined in the ILO List of Occupational Diseases.\n- AR 93. In the context of this Standard, work-related musculoskeletal disorders are covered under work-related ill health (and not injuries).\n- AR 94. The cases to be disclosed in paragraph 88(d) relate to cases of work-related ill health notified to the undertaking or identified by the undertaking through medical surveillance, during the reporting period. The undertaking might be notified of cases of work-related ill health through reports by affected people, compensation agencies, or healthcare professionals. The disclosure may include cases of work-related ill health that were detected during the reportingperiod among people who were formerly in the undertaking's workforce.\nGuidance on the number of days lost\nAR 95. The undertaking shall count the number of days lost such that the first full day and last dayof absence shall be included. Calendar days should be considered for the calculation, thus days on which the affected individual is not scheduled for work (for example, weekends, public holidays) will count as lost days.",

Providing a breakdown of *employees* by country gives insight into the distribution of activity across countries. The number of employees in each country is also a key trigger for many information, consultation and participation rights for workers and workers' representatives, both in the Union labour law acquis (for example, Directive 2009/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <sup>108</sup> \"European Works Councils Directive\" and Directive 2002/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council<sup>109</sup> \"Information and Consultation Directive\") and in national law (for example, rights to establish a works council or to have board level employee representation). Providing a breakdown of employees by gender and type of employment relationship gives insight into gender representation across the undertaking.

The definitions of permanent, temporary, non-guaranteed hours, full-time, and part-time *employees* differ between countries. If the undertaking has employees in more than one country, it shall use the definitions as per the national laws of the countries where the employees are based to calculate country-level data. The country-level data shall then be added up to calculate total numbers, disregarding differences in national legal definitions. Non-guaranteed hours employees are employed by the undertaking without a guarantee of a minimum or fixed number of working hours. The employee may need to make themselves available for work as required, but the undertaking is not contractually obliged to offer the employee a minimum or fixed number of working hours per day, week, or month. Casual employees, employees with zero-hour contracts, and on-call employees are examples that fallunder this category.\n- AR 57. Disclosing the number of *employees* at the end of the reporting period provides information forthat point in time, without capturing fluctuations during the reporting period. Disclosing these numbers in averages across the reporting period takes into account fluctuations during the reporting period.\n- AR 58. Quantitative data, such as the number of temporary or part-time *employees*, is unlikely to be sufficient on its own. For example, a high proportion of temporary or part-time employees could indicate a lack of employment security for employees, but it could equally signal workplace flexibility when offered as a voluntary choice. For this reason, the undertaking is required to disclose contextual information to help information *users*  interpret the data. The undertaking can explain the reasons for temporary employment. An example of such a reason is the recruitment of employees to undertake work on a temporary or seasonal project or event. Another example is the standard practice of offering a temporary contract (for example, six months) to new employees before an offer of permanent employment is made. The undertaking may also explain the reasons for nonguaranteed hours employment.\n- AR 59. For the own employee turnover calculation, the undertaking shall calculate the aggregate of the number of *employees* who leave voluntarily or due to dismissal, retirement, or death in service. The undertaking shall use this number for the numerator of the employee turnover rate and may determine the denominator used to calculate this rate and describe its methodology.\n- AR 60. Where data is not available for detailed information, the undertaking shall use an estimation of the employee number or ratios, in accordance with ESRS 1, and clearly identify where theuse of estimates has taken place.)",

        "[Context 6]: (*Metrics and targets*\n*Disclosure Requirement S1-7 – Characteristics of non-employees in the undertaking's own workforce*\nAR 61. This Disclosure Requirement provides insight into the undertaking's approach to employment, as well as the scope and nature of impacts arising from its employment practices. It also provides contextual information that aids an understanding of the information reported in otherdisclosures. This disclosure covers both individual contractors supplying labour to the undertaking (\"self-employed people\") and workers provided by\nundertakings primarily engaged in \"employment activities\" (NACE Code N78). If all the people performing work for the undertaking are *employees* and the undertaking does not have any people in its workforce who are not employees, this Disclosure Requirement is not material for the undertaking; notwithstanding,the undertaking may state this fact when disclosing the information required by Disclosure Requirement S1-6 as contextual information as this information can be relevant for the *users* of the *Sustainability Statement*.\n- AR 62. Examples of contractors (self-employed people) in the undertaking's *own workforce*  include: contractors hired by the undertaking to perform work that would otherwise be carried out by an employee; contractors hired by the undertaking to perform work in a public area (for example, on a road, on the street); and contractors hired by the undertaking to deliver the work/service directly at the workplace of a client of the organization. Examples of people employed by a third party engaged in 'employment activities' whose work is under the direction of the undertaking include: people who perform the same work that *employees* carry out, such as people whofill in for employees who are temporarily absent (due to illness, holiday, parental leave, etc.); people performing regular work at the same *site* as employees; and workers who are dispatched temporarily from another EU member state to work for the undertaking ('posted workers'). Examples of *value chain workers* (and thus of workers not in the undertaking's own workforce and reported under the scope of ESRS S2) include: workers for a *supplier* contracted by the undertaking who work on the supplier's premises using the supplier's work methods; workersfor a 'downstream' entity which purchases goods or services from the undertaking; and workers of an equipment supplier to the undertaking who, at one or more of the undertaking's workplaces, perform regular maintenance on the supplier's equipment (for example, photocopier) as stipulated in the contract between the equipment supplier and the undertaking.\n- AR 63.

In addition, it shall clearly identify the information that derives from actual data and estimates.\n- AR 64. Disclosing the number of people in the undertaking's *own workforce* who are not *employees* at the end of the reporting period provides information for that point in time without capturing fluctuations during the reporting period. Disclosing this number as an average across the reporting period considers fluctuations during the reporting period and can provide more insightful and relevantinformation for *users*.\n- AR 65. The information disclosed by the undertaking allows *users* to understand how the number of *non-employees* in the undertaking's *own workforce* varies during the reporting period or compared to the previous reporting period (i.e., whether the numbers have increased or decreased). The undertaking may also disclose the reasons for the fluctuations. For example, an increase in the number of non-employees during the reporting period could be due to a seasonal event. Conversely, a decrease in the number of non-employees compared to the previous reporting period could be due to the completion of a temporary project. If the undertaking discloses fluctuations, it shall also explain the criteria used to determine which fluctuations it discloses. If there are no significant fluctuations in the number of non-employees during the reporting period or between the currentand previous reporting period, the undertaking may disclose this information.)",

Specifically, if all the people performing work for your undertaking are employees and you do not have any people in your workforce who are not employees, this Disclosure Requirement is not material for your undertaking. In such a case, you may state this fact when disclosing the information required by Disclosure Requirement S1-6 as contextual information, as this information can be relevant for the users of the Sustainability Statement.\n\nHowever, if your undertaking does have non-employees in its workforce, you are required to disclose information about them. This includes contractors (self-employed people) and workers provided by undertakings primarily engaged in employment activities (NACE Code N78). You must disclose the number of non-employees in your own workforce at the end of the reporting period or as an average across the reporting period, considering fluctuations. If exact figures cannot be reported, estimates should be used according to the provisions in ESRS 1, and the information derived from actual data and estimates should be clearly identified.\n\nAdditionally, you may disclose the reasons for fluctuations in the number of non-employees during the reporting period or compared to the previous reporting period, and explain the criteria used to determine which fluctuations are disclosed. If there are no significant fluctuations, you may disclose this information as well.\n\nIn summary, you can exclude the data points related to non-employees if they are not present in your workforce, but if they are present, you must provide detailed disclosures as outlined in the context.

However, if this is your first year of reporting, you are not required to provide data for the previous two reporting periods, as stipulated in AR 100. This is because you would not have reported this information in previous sustainability reports.\n\n2. **Total Remuneration Ratio**:\n   - Similar to the gender pay gap, you must report the total remuneration ratio for the current reporting period. There is no explicit requirement to provide historical data for previous periods in the first year of reporting, as the focus is on the current period's data.\n\nIn summary, for the first reporting year, you can exclude historical data for both the gender pay gap and the total remuneration ratio, as the requirement to report for previous periods applies only if such data has been reported in earlier sustainability reports.

However, the requirement to estimate and report similar data for non-EEA regions with more than 50 employees representing more than 10% of total employees can be excluded in the first reporting year.
